title:  Rock-Paper-Sissors-Lizards-Spock
---
You will write a program that simulates the two-player game Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. This game is an extension of the traditional rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game with two additional choices: a lizard and Spock.
The game was popularized on The Big Bang Theory, though it was invented earlier as a way to reduce the probability of a tie in a regular rock-paper-scissors game.

Here's a brief introduction to the "regular" rock-paper-scissors game. RPS is two-player game that is played only with the hands. Each player mentally chooses one of "rock," "paper," or "scissors," and simultaneously the two players show (or, "throw") a hand symbol illustrating their choice. Rock uses a closed fist, paper uses an open hand with the fingers together, and scissors uses a fist with the pointer and middle finger extended.

Each one of the three hand gestures defeats one other gesture, and is defeated by one other gesture: rock crushes (beats) scissors, scissors cuts (beats) paper, and paper covers (beats) rock. If both players choose the same gesture, then the game is repeated. The game can be played until the first winner is determined or in repeated rounds. 

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) introduces two new gestures: lizard (all fingers touching the thumb) and Spock (fingers extended with a v-shape between the middle and ring figure). The new rules are as follows (in each rule, the first gesture beats the second)
```
Scissors cuts paper
Paper covers rock
Rock crushes lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes scissors
Scissors decapitates lizard
Lizard eats paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes rock
Rock crushes scissors
```
Note that this rule set is an extension of the classic RPS rules. The rule set still permits a fair game: every gesture defeats two other gestures and loses to two other gestures (see the diagram). And while the possibility of tying still exists, the probability of ties is lower.
The goal of your project is to create a two player game of RPSLS. At the beginning of the game, you should ask the players how many points it will take to declare the winner of RPSLS. Your program will allow the players to play multiple rounds of RPSLS until one of them reaches the critical number of points. The winner of each round receives one point. Although ties are not as common, your program must be able to handle ties by allowing the users to go again until you can announce a proper winner of that round. You must adhere to good programming techniques and style while making sure your code is efficient. You should spend a significant amount of time thinking about what chunks of code will be reused and how you can take advantage of this when you write your program.

Here is a checklist of things that your program should include:
```
Validate the user input (For example, make sure that a user doesn't enter -1 for the number of points that it takes to win the game).
Give appropriate feedback so it's clear to the users how the game is played and how the game is progressing.
Provide a short introduction to your game and a conclusion.
Your program must break ties by allowing the players to re-select gestures in each round until there is no more tie.
