Steps for recreating gabcompsci.me

Create a github account so you can store our copy of the website on your account.
Next go to the website [repository](https://github.com/Crazedwish/crazedwish.github.io) so you can copy and fork it to your own account
Fork the repo by going to the very top right and clicking on “Fork”
You will need to delete the CNAME file because you do not have a domain
Rename the repository to <yourusername>.github.io
