Computer Science Club Plan 2017-2018

Activities
Python
Teaching members a new scripting language that would be accelerated over a three week course. This will include teaching fundamentals and cross-applying ideas learned from Java to Python while allowing members who have never coded to become exposed to a completely new one.
Challenge Problems
Continue with challenge problems such as euler or logical problems like egg drop.
Wittry
We can immediately begin focus on Wittry by giving assignments now and creating groups later on. 
Website design
Brings in new members who do not need coding experience. Would take one meeting to set up a website for each member with a completely static page. 
Robotics + Hardware
Requires prior planning and cost; would need to see if it rallies a certain amount of members to justify a purchase. 

Meeting Schedule
Wednesday, November 29th
Wednesday, December 6th
Monday, December 11th 

Meetings will most likely be on Wednesday forward, but Monday, December 11th will be an exception due to the incoming finals week.

From January forward, we will begin with Wittry problems, but we can bring up the possibility of having multiple activities all occurring at the same time if there are a sufficient amount of members to diverge.
